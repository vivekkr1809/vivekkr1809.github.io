        <h2>Why Python?</h2>
        <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that has gained massive popularity in recent years. Known for its simplicity and readability, Python is an excellent choice for both beginner programmers and seasoned professionals working on complex software projects. Whether you're interested in web development, data analysis, machine learning, or automation, Python has tools and libraries that make development more efficient and enjoyable.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Easy to Learn:</strong> Python's syntax is clear and readable, which makes it a great starting point for new programmers.</li>
            <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> Python is used in various domains, including web development, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and data science.</li>
            <li><strong>Large Ecosystem:</strong> With a vast selection of libraries and frameworks, Python developers have access to powerful tools that make development faster and easier.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Features of Python</h2>
        <p>Here are some key features that make Python stand out:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Readable and Simple Syntax:</strong> Python's syntax is straightforward, using indentation to define blocks of code rather than braces `{}` or other symbols.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpreted Language:</strong> Python is an interpreted language, meaning you can run Python code directly without the need for compilation.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Typing:</strong> Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. The interpreter infers the type at runtime.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> Python is cross-platform, meaning it can run on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.</li>
            <li><strong>Extensive Standard Library:</strong> Python comes with a robust standard library that allows you to work with files, databases, and web services without needing third-party libraries.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Getting Started with Python</h2>
        <p>Before you begin coding in Python, you'll need to install the Python interpreter from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">official Python website</a>. Once installed, you can run Python interactively or execute Python scripts through a terminal or integrated development environment (IDE).</p>
        
        <h3>Your First Python Program</h3>
        <pre><code># This is a Python comment. Python ignores anything after the "#" symbol.
print("Hello, World!")  # Prints the string to the screen</code></pre>
        <p>When you run this program, Python will print:</p>
        <pre><code>Hello, World!</code></pre>
    </section>

        <h2>Basic Data Types and Variables</h2>
        <pre><code># Integer
x = 10

# Floating-point number
y = 3.14

# String
name = "Python"

# Boolean
is_active = True

print(x, y, name, is_active)</code></pre>
    </section>

        <h2>Control Flow: Conditions and Loops</h2>
        <pre><code># If-else condition
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult!")
else:
    print("You are a minor!")

# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)</code></pre>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly language that is widely used across different industries. Its clear syntax, powerful libraries, and supportive community make it a top choice for new developers. Whether you’re building a web app, analyzing data, or creating a machine learning model, Python is a great language to learn and work with.</p>
        <p>In future blog posts, we will dive deeper into Python’s advanced features, libraries, and frameworks, so stay tuned!</p>
