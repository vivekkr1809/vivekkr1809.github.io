    <h1>Introduction to Deep Learning: A Historical Overview</h1>
    <p>
        Deep learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence (AI), enabling breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and many other domains. This blog provides an overview of the evolution of deep learning over the last 50 years, with an emphasis on the transformative developments since 2012.
    </p>

    <h2>The Early Days: 1940s to 1980s</h2>
    <p>
        The foundational ideas of neural networks trace back to the 1940s with the introduction of the *perceptron* by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958 <span>[1]</span>. The perceptron was a simple computational model for binary classification:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">
        \( f(\mathbf{x}) = \text{sign}(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b) \)
    </div>
    <p>
        Despite initial enthusiasm, progress was hindered by the limitations of single-layer perceptrons, famously highlighted in the book *Perceptrons* by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert in 1969 <span>[2]</span>. Their work showed that perceptrons could not solve non-linear problems like XOR.
    </p>

    <h2>The Neural Network Renaissance: 1980s to 1990s</h2>
    <p>
        The introduction of the *backpropagation algorithm* in the 1980s, popularized by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams <span>[3]</span>, marked a significant milestone. Backpropagation enables neural networks with multiple layers to be trained by minimizing a loss function:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">
        \( L = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \ell(y_i, \hat{y}_i) \)
    </div>
    <p>
        Here, \( \ell \) is a loss function (e.g., mean squared error for regression or cross-entropy for classification).
    </p>

    <h2>The Deep Learning Revolution: Post-2012</h2>
    <p>
        Deep learning gained widespread attention in 2012 when Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton introduced *AlexNet* <span>[4]</span>. AlexNet demonstrated the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by achieving a breakthrough performance on the ImageNet dataset:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">
        \[ \text{Error rate (Top-5)}: 15.3\% \text{ (AlexNet, 2012)} \]
    </div>
    <p>
        Key advancements since then include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>2014: Introduction of *Generative Adversarial Networks* (GANs) by Ian Goodfellow <span>[5]</span>.</li>
        <li>2015: Deployment of deep reinforcement learning for Atari games by DeepMind using *Deep Q-Networks* <span>[6]</span>.</li>
        <li>2017: The *Transformer* architecture by Vaswani et al., leading to advancements in natural language processing <span>[7]</span>.</li>
        <li>2020s: Scaling of large language models such as GPT and the development of multimodal AI systems like DALL-E <span>[8]</span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mathematical Insights: Why Deep Networks Work</h2>
    <p>
        Modern deep networks achieve remarkable performance partly because of their capacity to approximate complex functions. According to the *Universal Approximation Theorem* <span>[9]</span>, a feedforward network with one hidden layer and a sufficient number of neurons can approximate any continuous function:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">
        \( f(x) \approx \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \sigma(\mathbf{w}_i^T \mathbf{x} + b_i) \)
    </div>
    <p>
        Here, \( \sigma \) is a non-linear activation function such as ReLU (\( \max(0, x) \)).
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Deep learning has experienced tremendous growth, fueled by algorithmic innovations, large-scale datasets, and powerful hardware accelerators like GPUs. In upcoming posts, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations and practical implementations of these breakthroughs.
