        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello there!

            I am Vivek, currently working as ML research scientist at KLA. I support the development of ML solutions to complement the metrology solution suites provided by KLA.
            
            Prior to joining KLA, I was analytics & insights engineer at PARC/Eloque where  I supported the development of structural health monitoring metrics through physics- and data-driven approaches. My work focused on defining sensing architectures to monitor the health of bridges using advanced sensors, big data analytics, and numerical models to extract key structural responses of interest.
            
            I completed my PhD and MS at Princeton University under the guidance of Prof. Branko Glišić. Prior to moving to US, I finished my undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering with Honors at IIT Bombay and a minor degree in Management from SJMSOM.
            
            Thanks for visiting!</p>
